/**
 * class Aphid.UI.View
 *
 * This class serves as a lightweight wrapper for a DOM element and as a
 * scaffold on which to build functionality on top of the wrapped HTML.
 *
 * ### Implementing Custom Views
 *
 * In general, [[Aphid.UI.View]] should be subclassed and not initialized
 * directly so that you may implement the functionality that is specific to
 * your custom view's requirements. To implement a custom view, simply create
 * a subclass of [[Aphid.UI.View]]:
 *
 *     var FooBarView = Class.create(Aphid.UI.View, {
 *       viewName: "FooBarView",
 *       fooLabel: false,
 *       contentView: false,
 *       viewDidFinishLoading: function()
 *       {
 *         this.fooLabel.element.update('Bar!');
 *       }
 *     });
 *
 * In this example, the `viewName` property specifies the name of the view
 * itself. This will be used to load the template (see the *View Templates*
 * section below for more details). The `fooLabel` and `contentView`
 * properties are outlets that will be wired up to elements within the view
 * template. Finally, the `viewDidFinishLoading` callback is called once the
 * view has loaded and in this example we are setting new content on our
 * `fooLabel` outlet.
 *
 * ### View Templates
 *
 * View templates are loaded asynchronously when the instance is first
 * initialized. The view template itself should be located in the path
 * that is defined by the `baseViewPath` instance property on your Application
 * delegate (which defaults to the relative path of *Views*). The filename of
 * the template should match the value of the [[Aphid.UI.View#viewName]]
 * property (i.e. *Views/FooBarView.html*).
 *
 *     <header>
 *       <h1 data-outlet="fooLabel">Foo</h1>
 *     </header>
 *     <section data-outlet="contentView">
 *       ...
 *     </section>
 *
 * View templates that are not wrapped in a single containing element will
 * automatically be wrapped in a <section/> element with the DOM ID set to
 * the `viewName` instance property.
 *
 * #### Outlets
 *
 * In traditional JavaScript integrations, you must peruse the DOM to select
 * the elements on which you wish to operate. In Aphid, we go one step further
 * and introduce the concept of outlets.
 *
 * An outlet is a reference to an element within a view template that is
 * automatically connected to your view instance once the view template has
 * been loaded. Outlets may be created by adding a custom attribute to the
 * element you wish to connect to named `data-outlet`. For example:
 *
 *     <header>
 *       <h1 data-outlet="viewHeader">...</h1>
 *     </header>
 *
 * You must also define an instance property in your custom view subclass
 * with the same name as the `data-outlet` attribute's value.
 *
 * When the view template loads, it will be scanned for all elements that
 * contain the data-outlet attribute and those elements will be wrapped by
 * a vanilla [[Aphid.UI.View]] instance and assigned to your view's matching
 * instance property.
 *
 * #### Actions
 *
 * Similar to outlets, actions allow you to easily map element events to
 * methods in your view subclass. For example, if you defined a `doSomething`
 * method in your subclass, you could connect a button to it with the
 * following:
 *
 *     <input type="button" data-action="doSomething" />
 *
 * This will call the `doSomething()` method on your subclass with the
 * triggered event as the first parameter. Your method signature should look
 * similar to the following:
 *
 *     doSomething: function(event)
 *     {
 *       alert('Doing it!');
 *     }
 *
 * **NOTE:** Actions are still under development and have a few shortcomings
 * that will need to be addressed, such as how to handle different event types
 * and custom parameter passing. For advanced usage and for the time being, it
 * is recommended that you set an outlet on the element and set up your own
 * event observers.
 *
 *
 * ### Delegates Methods
 *
 *  - `viewDidFinishLoading` â€” Called once the view template has been fully
 *    loaded and initialized. This should only ever be called once for a
 *    given view instance upon its first initialization.
