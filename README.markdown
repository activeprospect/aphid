# Aphid

Aphid is a collection of standard templates, layouts, stylesheets and
JavaScripts for use within ActiveProspect's web-based projects.

## Project Structure

  * **Assets** - Contains images, stylesheets, sounds and similar assets that
    are part of the Aphid library.
  * **Build** - The built Aphid project
  * **Demo** - A self-consuming demonstration application of Aphid.
  * **Documentation** - Documentation for Aphid (generated by PDoc)

      layer support, routing and other basic scaffolding.

      that use Aphid. This includes language and library extensions, a logger,
      browser compatibility shims and other useful common code.

  * **Vendor** - Imported 3rd-party libraries and projects, such as Prototype
    and script.aculo.us.

## Building Aphid

To build Aphid (which will compile and combine all of the library code and
assets into library form), simply run `rake build` from the Aphid source
folder.

The results of the build will be placed in the Build subfolder of the Aphid
source folder.
