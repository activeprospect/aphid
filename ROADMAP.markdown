# Aphid Roadmap

## Version 0.9.3 — December 2010

 * [Aphid.UI] Add support for layout controllers (i.e. TabbedLayoutController)
   that provides full-page layout CSS and wraps the appropriate controllers to
   manage view switching.
 
 * [Tools] Generating new Aphid applications with the "aphid new" command
   should support vendorizing Aphid as a git submodule. This should initialize
   the new application with git and add the submodule automatically.
 
 * [Tools] Add support for evaluating files in the Skeleton folder with Erb or
   another template language so that we can replace placeholders for the
   application name and do any other required evaluation at the time of setup.
 
 * [Aphid.UI.Window] Fix modal view presentation with the new overlay support
   in Aphid.UI.Window.

## Version 0.9.4 — January 2010

## Version 0.9.5 — February 2010

 * Initial Open Source Release.
