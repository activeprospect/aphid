# Publish Configuration for <%= @project_name %>

{

  #
  # Specify each of the hosts that you would like to publish to. You must
  # provide at least one host.
  #
  :hosts => [
    "web1.example.com",
    "web2.example.com"
  ],

  #
  # Specify the base path that the application will be published to. This path
  # will be created by the "publish:setup" Rake task and will also contain a
  # "releases" folder and a "current" symlink to the published release.
  #
  :path  => "/srv/application",

  #
  # Specify the user that you wish to use to connect to the hosts specified
  # above. If you do not specify a user, your login user will be used.
  #
  # :user => "jdoe",

  #
  # You may optionally specify multiple environments to publish to. The
  # settings provided for each environment below will override any of the
  # settings specified above. You may publish to a specific environment by
  # providing the PUBLISH= environment variable to the "rake publish" command
  # (i.e. "rake publish environment=production").
  #
  # :environments => {
  #   :staging => {
  #     :path => "/srv/application/staging",
  #     :hosts => [ "staging1.example.com" ]
  #   },
  #   :production => {
  #     :user => "production"
  #   }
  # },

  #
  # If you have defined multiple environments, it is recommended that you set
  # a default environment so that you don't have to specify the environment
  # with each rake task you invoke.
  #
  # :default_environment => :staging
