# New Aphid Application

Welcome to your new Aphid-based application. Please customize this file to the
specifics for your new application.

## Project Structure

  * **Application** - Contains models, views and controllers as well as the
    Application delegate.
  * **Public** - Files that should be placed in the Build output directory.
  * **Resources** - Contains view templates, images and stylesheets.
  * **Tests** - Contains tests for the application.
  * **Vendor** - Imported 3rd-party libraries and projects, including the
    Aphid library.

## Building the Application

To build your new application, simply run `rake build`. This will compile and
combine all of the application and library code and resources into the "Build"
subfolder of the project root.

### Automatically Building the Application

If you are actively working within the application, you may also run
`rake watch` from the project folder to watch the filesystem and automatically
rebuild the project when the source or any resources change.

## Launching the Application

Once you have successfully built the application, open the index.html file in
the "Build" subfolder of the project root.

## Publishing the Application

To publish the application, first follow the configuration instructions found
within the Publish.rb file. Once configured, you may type `rake publish` to
publish the compiled project to the configured servers.
